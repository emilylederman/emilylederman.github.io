## About this website
I've always wanted my to build my own little, clean, simple slice of the internet. Spurred by the pandemic in 2020, I built this website using Bootstrap JS. My evolution of who I am, and who I want to become, has been reflected in the changing design and structure of this site- for the better, I hope.
